# Motivation

One of the biggest challenge in Engineering is to ensure that everyone is on the same page.

This can relate to the codebase, the documentation, etc. It's often related as to be on the same **boat**.

One biggest challenge is to share cross-team knowledge and doing processes that involve multiple teams.
Translations are a good example of this. They involve:

- **Developers**: to implement the translation process
- **Translators**: to translate the content
- **Product Owners**: to validate the translations
- **Designers**: to ensure that the translations are correctly displayed
- **Content Writers**: to write the content
  etc.

A **raft** is a boat that has everything to be built. And for this, simplicity and efficient tools are needed.
